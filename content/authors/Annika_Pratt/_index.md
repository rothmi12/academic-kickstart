I grew up in Moorhead, MN. As a child I wanted to be a librarian, but those plans changed when I stumbled upon a television series of Neil Shubin’s Your Inner Fish. I found myself fascinated with genetics and evolution and decided to become a scientist. My interest in plant pathology grew in the summer of 2021 when I participated in an REU at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln. I spent the summer in a plant virology lab led by Dr. Hernan Garcia-Ruiz where I worked on developing a replication system for Maize chlorotic mottle virus in yeast. In spring of 2022 I earned a Bachelor of Arts from Concordia College in Moorhead with majors in biology, computer science, and Spanish. In August of 2022, I moved to Ohio and joined the Roth lab to pursue a PhD in Plant Pathology. Outside of the lab I enjoy figure skating, traveling, teaching fitness classes, birdwatching, and quilting.
