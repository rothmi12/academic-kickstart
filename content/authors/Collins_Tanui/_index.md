I grew up in Eldama Ravine a town in Baringo County, Kenya, a few miles north of the equator. When I was a child, I could not imagine being scientist one day. However, in college things took a positive direction thanks to my interaction with other researchers and scientists who influenced my career decision. I ended up having great interest in molecular biology, microbes, and microbes â€“ host interactions. 

My research interest revolves around host-pathogen interactions. The broader objective is aimed at using genomics to understand how a pathogen interacts and colonizes its host. The application of the transcriptomic profiling approach opens an avenue towards understanding the virulence mechanisms of plant pathogens and how they  interact within their major host. My graduate research projects on the interactions between _Pectobacterium brasiliense_ and potato interactions indicated that bacteria employ complex virulence mechanism to overpower their host and subsequently cause infections. 

Prior to joining the Roth research group, I was a post-doctoral associate at the Department of Nutrition and Food Science & the Center for Food Safety and Security Systems (CFS3) at the University of Maryland, College Park and my research was aimed at understanding how microbes interact with their host using machine learning. 

When not working, I love to spend quality time with my family, playing with my children, and going for a nature walks. I also like watching documentary channels.
