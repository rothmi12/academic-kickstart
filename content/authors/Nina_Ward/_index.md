I have pursued a career in the STEM field ever since I was a child. My first taste of lab exposure started at Kent State University where I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology with a minor in Chemistry. I started working for Dr. Joseph Ortiz in the geology department. This lab’s focus was on monitoring the harmful algae bloom (HAB) in Lake Erie as well as other smaller satellite lakes around Erie. My involvement in this lab included field work on the lake, taking water samples, reading the light reflectance using a radiometer, and processing satellite imagery for ground-truth data. I then moved onto work for Dr. John Finer at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. This lab’s focus was on utilizing highly expressed genetic promoters in soybean for genetic modification. My contributions to this lab include growth media prep, PCR prep, particle bombardment, gel electrophoresis, work in the greenhouse, and more. Once the project that I was funded under was completed, I started working for Dr Chris Blackwood at Kent State University. This lab’s purpose was to study the interactions between soil-borne microbes and tree roots, specifically their mycorrhizal interactions. Here, I was tasked with a copious number of PCRs and gel electrophoresis, as well as field work and greenhouse work. I greatly enjoyed working in this lab and I believe it prompted my interest in studying plant/microbe interaction. Once I graduated, my first full-time laboratory job was at Summit Environmental Technologies as an analyst for the volatile organics lab. Here I prepped solid and liquid samples, ran the samples through a gas chromatography machine and a mass spectrometer, and analyzed the resulting peaks. I often worked in the metals department prepping their samples as well. Our goal in this lab was to detect pollutants in different media such as wastewater, drinking water, and soil. I am now pursuing a PhD in Plant Pathology at the Ohio State University’s Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center where I will be studying microbes suspected in grafting failures in domestically grown chestnut trees. In my free time, you will likely find me outside hiking (as long as the weather is reasonable) and I greatly enjoy using the iNaturalist app on hikes to determine different taxon in real time.
