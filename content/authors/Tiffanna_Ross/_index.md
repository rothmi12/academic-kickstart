*Biography*
I am from the eco-tourism country, Guyana, the only English-speaking country in the continent of South America. Agriculture was not always my first choice. I had intended to study medicine at the University of Guyana, but slots for admission to the biology program were full. So, I signed on for agriculture instead, planning to transfer after one semester. But I developed a curiosity for agriculture, and it worked out for the best! After earning my bachelor’s degree, I worked for the National Agricultural Research and Extension Institute in my home country and was selected for a master’s-level research assistantship at University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff as a top graduate in my program. While working toward my MS in agricultural regulations, I applied to Purdue University where I later obtained my Ph.D. in Botany and Plant Pathology. 

*Research interests:*
My research interests lie within field crop pathology, understanding plant pathogens, their interactions, biology, genetics and management. My current research focuses on soybean-Sclerotinia effector-R-genes interactions, genomics and management in Midwestern United States. During my doctoral program at Purdue University, I actively carried out research that bridged the gaps in knowledge and expanded our understanding into the population dynamics, biology, and management of the newly emerged corn-Phyllachora maydis pathosystem in the Midwest.

Apart from this, I have a background in molecular biology and plant biotechnology, which I developed during my master studies at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. There I learnt the importance of how to engineer crops so that they can withstand or tolerate plant disease and environmental disorders creating a well-rounded background in this field for myself. I have hopes of becoming a leading scientist/pioneer in field crop pathology with global impacts and collaborations. Find a full list of publications on my Google Scholar page linked above.

Apart from research, I enjoy going to the beach though I’m not a swimmer, singing, dancing, meeting new people and watching Netflix series.
