I grew up in Canton, Ohio, only 40 minutes away from the OARDC. I began my academic pursuits at Kent State University as an Athletic Training student. I really enjoyed medical sciences and specifically the process of diagnosing and treating orthopedic injuries. Despite that, I really became interested in pursuing a career in biological sciences and I switched my majors during my sophomore year. This was when I was first introduced to the amazing world of mycology, soil biology, and plant pathology.  After graduating in 2017 I spent six months in the Dorrance Soybean Pathology Lab as a research assistant, followed by moving to Knoxville, Tennessee. There I pursued my Masters of Entomology and Plant Pathology at the University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) advised under Dr. Zachariah Hansen the Specialty Crop Pathologist. My thesis addressed fungicide resistance and the population genetics of _Phytophthora capsici_ found throughout the state of Tennessee. Near the end of my time at UTK, I decided I wanted to get my PhD and I applied to OSU and was accepted into the Plant Pathology program and joined the Roth Lab in August of 2021. When not working, I love to spend time with my family and friends, cook, rock climb, disc golf, whitewater kayak, camp, and play video games. In general, I really enjoy exploring nature, having new life experiences, and spending quality time with people I love.
