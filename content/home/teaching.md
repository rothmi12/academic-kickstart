  description = "<u>Description</u>: In 2018, I took ISE 870 - Teaching College Science, taught by Dr. Joyce Parker. The goal of the course was to explore different teaching methods in our disciplines; the natural sciences. In this class we learned how to develop learning goals, how to lead students towards those learning objectives, and assess student understanding at many levels. <br /><br /><u>Teaching Materials Developed</u>: Through this class, I presented two 15-minute mini-lectures for a class I am interested in developing named 'Tools in Modern Genetics: Applications and Mechanisms'. In this class, students will have successfully passed two semesters of general biology. In the first lecture, I briefly covered the basics of cells, DNA structure, and organization. Then, I lay down framework for why students might be interested in Genetic differences by providing three short observations of physical differences in animals. Using one of these observation examples, I provide more information as to why it may be of interest to change the genetic material of an animal. Finally, we take the lesson learned and try to apply it to a new situation, discussing pros, cons, and ethics behind the desired outcome of the genetic changes. In the second lecture, I implemented an activity to represent a physical depiction of gene expression in action. First, we review the 'central dogma' of molecular biology: DNA --> RNA --> protein. Then, we discuss a real-life example, the lactose inducible gene expression system in bacteria; the lac operon. Students get into small groups and 'become' a single bacterial cell. They are given a genotype, along with physical objects to represent the proteins they are able to express. They are then asked to determine if their bacterial cell will survive on new media containing lactose, but the genotypes are assigned so that none of them can! Finally, they are given an option to acquire one of four plasmids in order to survive. If they choose correctly, all groups can live. If not, some groups still will not survive. At the end of the lecture, I suggest a way to study these complicated gene expression systems, and ask them to consider how we can take advantage of such inducible systems in molecular biology. For the final project in this class, I developed a 30-minute lecture with a classmate that would serve as a first or second lecture for the class I proposed above; 'Tools in Modern Genetics: Applications and Mechanisms'. In this lecture, we talk about class structure, assess student learning from previous classes through interactive clicker questions, and open up dialogue with some discussion questions. Since students should know the answers to most of the clicker and discussion questions from previous classes, we then challenge the students to think about how we came to know these things. After this challenge, we provide a brief history of core experiments that provided significant evidence towards the concepts we had just discussed. Finally, we expand on the concepts by showing how these theories can be put into action and used to move science forward even further. For details about all of the topics covered in ISE 870, or to see any of my lecture slides, download the attached [PDF](files/ISE870.pdf). <br /><br /><u>Reflection</u>: I knew I liked teaching before I had taken this class, but I always thought it was pretty straight forward and simple. I did not realize how much thought goes into each lecture, activity, and exam in order to convey information, reinforce theories, and assess understanding. It turns out, my previous teaching experiences were extraordinarily well organized, and I was able to step right in and teach effectively. This class challenged me to think about a class that doesn't exist yet, that I would like to teach some day. Deciding on a topic was easy, but realizing what it takes to make it come to life is an incredibly difficult task. I appreciate what this class has taught me so that when a future university asks me to design a class, I will be able to jump right in and approach it in a way that will benefit student understanding."

  description = "<u>Description</u>: I was able to attend the Certification in College Teaching Institute in 2018 and heard from many great speakers. To help us think critically about creating and fostering an effective and inclusive learning environment, Dr. Bennett Goldberg challenged us to think about the best and worst classes we've ever taken. Several people gave feedback on features of their favorite classroom, and others had strong feelings about aspects of their least favorite classes. Dr. Goldberg's suggestions were to engage the students by asking questions in class, allowing time for students to come up with an answer on their own, discuss their answer with a neighbor, then come together and discuss the different answers as a whole class. <br /><br /><u>Reflection</u>: Dr. Goldberg pointed out something that really resonated with me. A key underlying feature in all of my favorite classrooms has been the inclusion of student involvement in the classroom. Being spoken at, with no opportunity for getting involved, does not work well for me. I am able to learn and memorize surface level information this way, but in order for long term learning I need to roll the idea around in my head and challenge it verbally. I learned a lot about how to design engaging questions and all of the available online polling options that can be used real-time in class to ask questions and collect answers from students. However, I was also left with some questions about how to balance questioning vs. lecture material and how to give feedback to individuals who are reluctant to engage during class time.

  description = "<u>Description</u>: Drs. Rique Campa, Melissa McDaniels, and Judith Stoddart led the section on technology in the classroom. They gave many examples of good uses of technology, highlighting a particularly interesting case using social media. An ornithology professor engaged her students via Twitter, encouraging students to identify pictures of birds that she saw on campus, and the students started posting pictures of birds they saw around campus too! <br /><br /><u>Reflection</u>: My biggest take away from this section was that 'technology' does not mean 'digital' or 'fancy'. It means being creative with materials that you have access to. In one activity we did, our table was given an index card with a single item on it. With our favorite topic in mind, we each had to design a lesson plan that incorporated that single item. Luckily for us, our group got 'a paper clip', because the group next to us got 'a hive of bees'. But regardless, it was fun to stretch our imaginations and create analogies that can incorporate things we don't typically associated with a lesson plan. Just because fancy tools might be available, doesn't mean they are appropriate to use. The most important thing is to determine the learning objective first, then apply the best technology to achieve the objective.

In a breakout session, our group discussed the mission statement of a community college and how our teaching approaches might change given the mission of the community college. <br /><br /><u>Reflection</u>: In another breakout session, Dr. Tony Nunez helped us understand the University context further. One thing that he said that hit home for me was, 'Despite your required teaching percentage, it is critical to be present in the classroom when you are teaching.' Having done my PhD work at a Research Institution, sometimes teaching can feel like a hassle or a nuisance. But whether or not you want to be teaching that day, or you are distracted by something else, it is important to give the students your full effort each day. Another big difference between universities is the budget, so choosing materials and activities that can scale across all types of classrooms is advantageous and can relate to students from all backgrounds.

  description = "<b><u>Introduction</u></b><br />Science is driven by numbers, data, and evidence. Professors who teach science in college are trained scientists, and when they teach science, they often assess student understanding in the same way they approach science; by gathering data. Unfortunately, many exams that professors implement don't test true understanding and comprehension. Instead, these exams test a student's ability to produce a specific number with a specific approach. If the student provides the correct answer, it is assumed to be evidence of the student's understanding. However, given enough practice, many students are capable of solving exam problems even though they may have significant misconceptions regarding the principle the question is addressing. In IBIO 341, Fundamental Genetics, exams are heavily weighted on problem-solving, showing work, explaining the approach, and interpreting the result. These questions test knowledge, comprehension, application, and analysis of material, but fail to test higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy.<br />I want to examine how writing exercises affect student abilities to learn and apply fundamental principles and techniques in Genetics. The goal of these writing exercises is to push students into the synthesis and evaluation levels of Bloom's taxonomy, while also allowing an opportunity to intervene when misconceptions are apparent. This project aims to answer the question; does writing short essays on specific genetic principles and techniques, backed by peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed sources, improve student understanding of the principles and techniques?<br /><br /><b><u>Materials and Methods</u></b><br /> I have helped teach 'Fundamental Genetics' (IBIO 341) in the spring semesters of 2016, 2018, and 2019 (SS16, SS18, SS19). In 2016 and 2018, we did not implement writing assignments prior to exams. For 2019, I assigned a writing prompt two weeks before each exam and returned them one week prior to the exam, for a total of 3 writing assignments. I asked students to submit written summaries digitally. These summaries were worth two points. One point was awarded for turning in the summary with a minimum of 400 words. One point was given for using a minimum of 3 sources. Two of these sources were required to be a peer-reviewed or professional document from a trusted scientific source (i.e. journal article, published protocol, scientific company webpage). The third source could be from anywhere, including non-peer-reviewed sources (i.e. Wikipedia, YouTube, etc.). The objective of this 0-2 grading scale was to have students fall into one of three categories; those who didn't do the assignment (0), those who didn't try to synthesize and evaluate relevant content (1), and those who pushed themselves to master the content via synthesis and evaluation (2). While grading assignments, I learned that many students don't understand how to properly cite sources, with some using direct quotations from the sources rather than putting the content into their own words. In instances where direct quotes were used, I deducted half a point (0.5). <br />There were two sections of this class in 2019 with approximately 200 students each. These writing assignments were only implemented in one of the sections. I compared the exam grades from the 2019 section that had writing assignments to the exam grades of 2016, 2018, and 2019 sections that did not have writing assignments. To determine the impact of the writing assignments, I analyzed exam grades following each of the three exams. Since 2016 and 2018 classes also had 3 exams, I was able to compare the 2019 section with writing assignments to many different sections.<br /><br /><b><u>Results</u></b><br />In general, the distribution of exam grades were similar across exam 1, exam 2, and the final exam, ranging from approximately 20% to 100%. Students who followed instructions and submitted the written assignment with the appropriate length and references and scored a 2 on the assignment prior to exam 1 had significantly better exam 1 scores than students who turned in the assignment but failed to reach the word limit or use 3 appropriate sources (Fig. 1 A). Students who failed to turn in the written assignment did not do significantly better or worse than any other category. Exam 2 and final exam grades did not see statistical differences based on their written summary grades. (Fig. 1 A). While students assigned the summary assignments performed numerically better on exams 1 and 2, these grades were not significantly higher than students who were not assigned the summary assignments (Fig. 1 B).![Figure 1](files/mentored-teaching-fig1.jpg)<br /><b>Figure 1</b>. The effect of pre-exam written summary assignments on exam grades. Summary assignment scores had a significant impact on exam 1 grades, but not on exam 2 or final exam grades (A). Students who were assigned the exam summaries did not perform significantly different on the exam than students who were not assigned the exam summary (B). Class averages are presented at the base of each bar chart.<br />Exam grades were next examined over the three semesters that I have taught. In 2019, the exam summaries were assigned while in 2016 and 2018 they were not assigned. Exam 1 grades were not significantly different across years, but exam 2 and the final exam did show significant differences across years (Fig. 2). In 2018, students did significantly better on exam 2 than in either 2016 or 2019, while students in 2019 also performed significantly better on exam 2 than students in 2016 (Fig. 2). However, students in 2018 performed significantly worse than students in 2016 and 2019 on the final exam (Fig. 2).<br />![Figure 2](files/mentored-teaching-fig2.jpg)<br /><b>Figure 2</b>. Exam grades across semesters. Exam 1 grades were not influenced by semester, but Exam 2 and the Final Exam did display significant semester-specific differences.<br /><br /><b><u>Discussion</u></b><br /><br />In science classrooms, exam questions are often designed such that a single word or phrase is expected. However, this type of question does not test true understanding of material. By requiring a written response to given prompts, students were forced to internalize content and describe their understanding in their own words. This type of assignment did have an effect on one of the exam grades, but not consistently across all three.<br />Students who met all requirements for the first writing assignment faired better on the first exam than students who failed to meet the full requirements of the writing assignment. Interestingly, students who did not complete this first assignment at all faired just as well as those who earned full credit. This result indicates that some students were prepared enough to do well on the exam without submitting their writing assignment. These types of students may have felt confident enough in their understanding that they did not feel the benefit of completing the assignment. Students who completed the assignment but did not stretch their understanding by meeting the word limit and incorporating sources likely felt confident with their understanding of the content as well, hence the lack of effort to meet all of the assignment requirements. Exam 1 scores indicate that this was a false sense of confidence for this group of students. In contrast, some students who met all requirements of the writing assignment still performed poorly on the exam, indicating that some students in this group may have had a false sense of security in their understanding of the material. <br />Interestingly, there were significant differences in exam scores across years, particularly for exam 2 and the final exam. These analyses were performed to determine if the writing assignments allowed students to achieve higher scores in 2019 than in previous years. Exam 1 results indicate that the writing assignments had no effect on exam scores compared to previous years. The significant differences in exam 2 and final exam scores could suggest an effect of the writing assignment, but more likely capture the differences in the order the content was presented. In spring semester 2016 (SS16), the most difficult content was covered prior to exam 2, which resulted in significantly lower scores compared to SS18 and SS19. Similarly, the most difficult content was covered prior to the final in SS18, resulting in significantly lower scores compared to SS16 and SS19.<br />A student who has good writing skills may also be talented at critical thinking and problem solving. These skills are highly covariant among students. Therefore, we cannot rule out that the correlations between full scores on the writing assignment and the high exam scores are due to a general 'good student' effect. I made attempts to control for this by treating the student's final GPA in the class as a random effect and regressing the writing assignment grades with the exam scores. However, results indicated that the final GPA explained very small amount of variation in the relationship between writing scores and exam grades. If I had prior knowledge of what grade each student expected to receive in the class, this information along with final GPA may have explained more variance because it would have given an indication of effort that each student expected to put into this class.<br /><br /><b><u>Conclusions</u></b><br />The most advanced form of science requires frequent scientific writing. Scientists become professionals by performing research and writing a thesis. Once the doctorate is earned, scientists continue writing to publish their findings in peer reviewed journals. And seasoned scientists write many grant proposals to try and fund further research. It follows then that students in science classrooms should be expected to write in order to show their understanding of classroom material. While the results of these writing assignments were not consistently observed across all three exams, I believe that it is a worthwhile endeavor to add more writing into science classes. A few students mentioned that they found the assignments helpful, and with some more carefully designed controls, a direct impact of writing assignments on student understanding in classrooms might be accomplished.<br /><br /><b><u>Acknowledgements</u></b><br />I would like to thank Dr. Terri McElhinny and Dr. Mariah Meek for the opportunity to conduct this project in their classrooms, and for their useful discussion and guidance in my efforts to become a better teacher."

  description = "I have had great teachers that have influenced my life in powerful ways. My mother was a junior high math teacher, and her help in my schooling was natural. My father is a farmer, and taught me all about caring for cattle, tending to a field, and testing moisture levels of grain before harvest. I didn’t realize it at the time, but they were fostering my inquisitive nature by doing the things they loved, and welcoming my persistent questions of how and why. As I continued through school, I kept this same attitude, frequently questioning how things worked, what it meant, and how it could be applied to new problems. It came so naturally to me that I was often surprised when my friends simply asked questions to get an answer they needed to complete an assignment, not because they were interested in learning. Thankfully, my inquisitive habits were fostered and encouraged by my teachers in grade school and my professors in college. However, I believe that it is becoming increasingly common in today’s classrooms for students to ask questions only with a task-oriented goal in mind. Without promoting creative applications of classroom concepts, students see homework as a task that needs to be finished rather than an opportunity to apply knowledge to a new task. Therefore, students rarely ask questions out of curiosity and fascination, instead asking questions only to help them accomplish the task of finishing their homework. I believe this is the primary motivation for most student questions in introductory classes – to get an answer so they can move on to other things. <br /><br />I have three semesters of teaching experience in introductory genetics, which is a discipline where students are heavily evaluated on their problem-solving abilities, and less so on their ability to memorize information. As a result, I have seen teachers fall into the trap of teaching the basic mechanisms of genetics right away, so that students can get practice using them to solve problems. However, without providing context and application beforehand, the motivation for students to gain practice and finish homework remains task-oriented. As a teacher, I try to foster critical thinking in my classrooms by providing real-life applications. By providing context and applications of the materials, I build a case for the importance and implications of genetics and research, providing motivation to learn. I believe this framework allows students in my class to solve the problems that have been assigned and also explore other problems that could be solved with similar approaches. For me, the primary motivation to understand genetics is agriculture. Knowing how genetic principles can be applied to prevent plant diseases is fascinating to me. Each time I teach, I aim to connect with students to find their motivation for learning these principles and cater to those motivations. <br /><br />In many traditional classrooms, teachers provide practice problems for students that are based on similar practice problems from previous years. Using the same problem structure, assignment after assignment, reinforces habitual approaches to problem solving rather than critical thinking. In contrast, a well-formulated question based on something the students can directly relate to or observe can intrigue even the least interested students. Sometimes, the best questions to pose inside the classroom are ones in which there is no known answer. I aim to break with this traditional classroom style and challenge students to think in new ways. One of the ways I build this type of teaching environment is through a flipped classroom design. By taking advantage of modern technologies, I require students to learn core concepts on their own time through online materials that I develop. Preparing online material ahead of class and asking students to watch them provides accountability for both me and my students. Once in the classroom, I take the opportunity to present real-life scenarios and practice applying the core concepts from the pre-class lectures to the scenario presented in the classroom. Posting material online also providing the opportunity to watch the lesson as many times as they desire, which can reinforce concepts for many students. <br /><br />I am a firm believer that everyone learns differently, and that learning must take place in the mind of the learner. To evaluate learning, I frequently ask students to formulate their understanding of a topic in their own words, using simple terms or complex jargon; whatever they need to convey their understanding. I have found it more successful to truly gauge a students understanding of a certain topic by reading their explanations of a topic rather than grading standard homework questions. When misconceptions are apparent, I can evaluate where the misconceptions lie and find a new way to explain the same concept. In my experience, real-life examples or well-thought-out analogies can be very efficient at conveying the same concepts in new ways that connect with struggling students. By following along with an analogy, students apply scientific principles to situations that do not appear scientific. When presented in class, analogies often connect to a higher number of students and grab their attention because it appears that we are changing subjects. Instead, my analogies encourage students to think about classroom materials in unique ways that don’t feel like homework. Presenting concepts and problem-solving techniques in these different contexts, they are more likely to recall and apply the concepts to new situations. I want my students to be problem-solvers because this skill will allow them to become a valuable employee to any employer, even outside of science."
