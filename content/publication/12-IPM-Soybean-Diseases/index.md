abstract: Soybean (*Glycine max* L.) is a major crop grown in the United States but is susceptible to many diseases that cause significant yield losses each year. Consistent threats exist across both northern and southern production regions and include the soybean cyst nematode, charcoal rot, and seedling diseases. In contrast, significant soybean diseases like Phytophthora stem and root rot, sudden death syndrome, and Sclerotinia stem rot (white mold) are intermittent threats that can be heavily influenced by environmental factors. Additional threats to soybean production that have emerged in recent years as more common problems in soybean production include root-knot and reniform nematodes, frogeye leaf spot, and Diaporthe diseases. Disease in any crop will only occur when the three components of the disease triangle are present; a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a conducive environment. If an environment is becoming more conducive for a particular disease, it is important that farmers and practitioners are prepared to manage the problem.The information in this review was compiled to help assist agriculturalists in being proactive in managing new soybean diseases that may be emerging in new areas.To do this, we provide; 1) an overview of the impact and disease cycle for major soybean diseases currently causing significant yield losses in the United States, 2) a comprehensive review of the current management strategies for each soybean disease, and 3) insights into the epidemiology of each pathogen, including the likelihood of outbreaks and expansion to additional geographic regions based on current trends in climate change.
