abstract: Soybean production in the Upper Midwest of the United States is affected by Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) caused by the fungal pathogen *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, and genetic resistance is an important management strategy for this disease. However, assessing genetic resistance to *S. sclerotiorum* is challenging, because a standardized method to examine resistance across genotypes is lacking. Using a panel of nine diverse *S. sclerotiorum* isolates, four soybean lines were assessed for reproducible responses to *S. sclerotiorum* infection. Significant differences in SSR severity were found across isolates (P < 0.01) and soybean lines (P < 0.01), including one susceptible, two moderately resistant, and one highly resistant line. These four validated lines were used to screen 11 other soybean genotypes to evaluate their resistance levels, and significant differences were found across genotypes (P < 0.01). Among these 11 genotypes, five commercial and public cultivars displayed high resistance and were assessed in field studies across the Upper Midwest growing region for their response to SSR and yield. These five cultivars resulted in low disease levels (P < 0.01) in the field which were consistent with greenhouse experiments. Yield was significantly different in fields with disease present (P < 0.01) and disease absent (P < 0.01), and the order of cultivar performance was consistent between environments where disease was present or absent suggesting resistance prevented yield loss to disease. This study suggests the use of a soybean check panel can accurately assess SSR resistance in soybean germplasm and aid in breeding and commercial soybean development.
