abstract: Scientific communication is facilitated by a data-driven, scientifically sound taxonomy that considers the end-user's needs and established successful practice. Previously (Geiser et al. 2013), the *Fusarium* community voiced near unanimous support for a concept of *Fusarium* that represented a clade comprising all agriculturally and clinically important Fusarium species, including the *F. solani* Species Complex (FSSC). Subsequently, this concept was challenged by one research group (Lombard et al. 2015) who proposed dividing *Fusarium* into seven genera, including the FSSC as the genus *Neocosmospora*, with subsequent justification based on claims that the Geiser et al. (2013) concept of *Fusarium* is polyphyletic (Sandoval-Denis et al. 2018). Here we test this claim, and provide a phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous protein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of *Fusarium* including the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in support of a *Fusarium* that includes the FSSC and several other basal lineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, students and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In recognition of this monophyly, 40 species recently described as *Neocosmospora* were recombined in *Fusarium*, and nine others were renamed *Fusarium*. Here the global *Fusarium* community voices strong support for the inclusion of the FSSC in *Fusarium*, as it remains the best scientific, nomenclatural and practical taxonomic option available.
