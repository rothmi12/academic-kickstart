abstract: Soybean resistance to sudden death syndrome (SDS) is composed of foliar resistance to phytotoxins and root resistance to pathogen invasion. There are more than 80 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and dozens of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with soybean resistance to SDS. The validity of these QTL and SNPs is questionable because of the complexity in phenotyping methodologies, the disease synergism between SDS and soybean cyst nematode (SCN), the variability from the interactions between soybean genotypes and environments, and the inconsistencies in the QTL nomenclature. This review organizes SDS mapping results and proposes the Rfv (resistance to *Fusarium virguliforme*) nomenclature based on supporting criteria described in the text. Among ten reproducible loci receiving our Rfv nomenclature, Rfv18-01 is mostly supported by field studies and it co-localizes to the SCN resistance locus rhg1. The possibility that Rfv18-01 is a pleiotropic resistance locus and the concern about Rfv18-01 being confounded with Rhg1 is discussed. On the other hand, Rfv06-01, Rfv06-02, Rfv09-01, Rfv13-01, and Rfv16-01 were identified both by screening soybean leaves against phytotoxic culture filtrates and by evaluating SDS severity in fields. Future phenotyping using leaf- and root-specific resistance screening methodologies may improve the precision of SDS resistance, and advanced genetic studies may further clarify the interactions among soybean genotypes, *F. virguliforme*, SCN, and environments. The review provides a summary of the SDS resistance literature and proposes a framework for communicating SDS resistance loci for future research considering molecular interactions and genetic breeding for soybean SDS resistance.
