abstract: Tar spot is a fungal disease complex of corn that has been destructive and yield limiting in Central and South America for nearly 5 0 years. Phyllachora maydis, the causal agent of tar spot, is an emerging corn pathogen in the United States, first reported in 2015 from major corn producing regions of the country. The tar spot disease complex putatively includes Monographella maydis (syn. Microdochium maydis), which increases disease damage through the development of necrotic halos surrounding tar spot lesions. These necrotic halos, termed “fish-eye” symptoms, have been identified in the United States, though Monographella maydis has not yet been confirmed. A recent surge in disease severity and loss of yield attributed to tar spot in the United States has led to increased attention and expanded efforts to understand the disease complex and how to manage it. In this study, next- generation sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) ribosomal DNA was used to identify fungal taxa that distinguish tar spot infections with or without fish-eye symptoms. Fungal communities within tar spot only lesions were significantly different from communities having fish-eye symptoms. Two low abundance operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified as Microdochium sp., however, neither were associated with fish-eye symptom development. Interestingly, a single OTU was found to be significantly more abundant in fish-eye lesions compared with tar spot lesions and had a 91% ITS1 identity to Neottiosporina paspali. In addition, the occurrence of this OTU was positively associated with Phyllachora maydis fish-eye symptom networks, but not in tar spot symptom networks. Neottiosporina paspali has been reported to cause necrotic lesions on various monocot grasses. Whether the related fungus we detected is part of the tar spot complex of corn and responsible for fish-eye lesions remains to be tested. Alternatively, many OTUs identified as Phyllachora maydis, suggesting that different isolate genotypes may be capable of causing both tar spot and fish-eye symptoms, independent of other fungi. We conclude that Monographella maydis is not required for fish-eye symptoms in tar spot of corn.
