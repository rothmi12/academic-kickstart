# Tips and tricks for github.io website

# A few reminders:
# /Users/rothmitc/Roth_Website/My_Website is where everything is located

# 1. Open academic.Rproj in R-studio

# 2. To toggle different pre-filled sections on home page on and off:
#	- Go to Content -> Home
#	- Open whatever section you want to toggle on or off (ex. projects.md)
# - To test whether or not the toggle worked, view the edited website locally
#   - Enter Terminal, type 'hugo server'
#   - Open a Chrome tab, go to 'http://localhost:1313/'
#   - As long as 'hugo server' is running, all changes made in R-studio will be rendered in real time on Chrome
# - NOTE: After you toggle something on or off, you need to make sure that now becomes a clickable option across your header
#   - To do this go to config -> _default -> menus.toml
#   - Add a new [main] category, and make sure the "url" links to the same name of the file you toggled on or off

# 3. In order to update the actual rothmi12.github.io website...
# - Remember, making changes in R-studio means you're making changes to the local git repository (macbook)
# - You can use the 'hugo server' trick above to see all the changes you're making. But when you're done...
# - You need to use git to add, commit, and push the changes you made to the remote git repository (github)
#   - Go to /Users/rothmitc/Roth_Website/My_Website in Terminal. Enter the following commands:
#     - git add .
#     - git commit -m "<COMMIT NOTE GOES HERE>" #example "Updated publications"
#     - git push -u origin master
#     - hugo
#     - cd public
#     - git add .
#     - git commit -m "<COMMIT NOTE GOES HERE>" #example "Updated publications"
#     - git push -u origin master
